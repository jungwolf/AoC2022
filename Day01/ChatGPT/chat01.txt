Think like an Oracle Sql developer to solve the following problem. It is presented as word problem. Write a sql statement that will solve it.

Elves take turns writing down the number of Calories contained by the various meals, snacks, rations, etc. that they've brought with them, one item per line. Each Elf separates their own inventory from the previous Elf's inventory (if any) by a blank line.

For example, suppose the Elves finish writing their items' Calories and end up with the following list:

1000
2000
3000

4000

5000
6000

7000
8000
9000

10000
This list represents the Calories of the food carried by five Elves:

The first Elf is carrying food with 1000, 2000, and 3000 Calories, a total of 6000 Calories.
The second Elf is carrying one food item with 4000 Calories.
The third Elf is carrying food with 5000 and 6000 Calories, a total of 11000 Calories.
The fourth Elf is carrying food with 7000, 8000, and 9000 Calories, a total of 24000 Calories.
The fifth Elf is carrying one food item with 10000 Calories.
In case the Elves get hungry and need extra snacks, they need to know which Elf to ask: they'd like to know how many Calories are being carried by the Elf carrying the most Calories. In the example above, this is 24000 (carried by the fourth Elf).

Find the Elf carrying the most Calories. How many total Calories is that Elf carrying?

To solve this problem using Oracle SQL, we first need to assume a structure for the data. Since the data is presented as a list of calorie values separated by blank lines, we can assume that this data is stored in a table with at least two columns: one for the calorie value and another to identify the different Elves or groups. However, the challenge is that the data is separated by blank lines, which is not a standard format for SQL databases.

For the sake of this solution, let's assume we have a table named Elf_Food with two columns: Elf_ID (to identify each Elf) and Calories (to store the calorie value of each food item). The Elf_ID can be a sequential number that increases every time a blank line is encountered in the original list.

Given this structure, the SQL query to find the Elf carrying the most Calories would involve summing the Calories for each Elf and then finding the maximum total. Here's how you could write this query:

sql
Copy code
SELECT Elf_ID, SUM(Calories) AS Total_Calories
FROM Elf_Food
GROUP BY Elf_ID
ORDER BY Total_Calories DESC
FETCH FIRST 1 ROW ONLY;
This query does the following:

Groups the records by Elf_ID.
Calculates the total calories (Total_Calories) for each Elf by summing the Calories column.
Orders the results in descending order based on Total_Calories.
Selects only the first row, which corresponds to the Elf carrying the most calories.
However, this solution assumes that the data is already structured in a way that SQL can process (i.e., with distinct Elf_ID values for each Elf's list of items). If the data is not in this format, you would first need to transform the data into this structured format, which could involve additional steps outside of SQL or using more advanced SQL techniques like window functions or stored procedures to parse and assign Elf_ID values.

The data is originally in a text file. I've loaded the file into a table named input_data with columns (linenumber, linetext). linenumber is used to represent the position of the line in the text file. How do you solve the problem using this table?
ChatGPT
Given that the data is in a table named input_data with columns linenumber and linetext, where linetext contains the calorie values and blank lines to separate different Elves, we can approach this problem by first identifying each Elf's group of entries and then summing the calories for each group.

We'll use a common table expression (CTE) to assign group numbers to each set of entries. The idea is to increment the group number every time we encounter a blank line. Then, we can sum the calories within each group and find the group with the maximum total calories.

Here's how you can write the SQL query:

sql
Copy code
WITH GroupedData AS (
    SELECT 
        linenumber, 
        linetext,
        SUM(CASE WHEN TRIM(linetext) IS NULL OR TRIM(linetext) = '' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) 
            OVER (ORDER BY linenumber) AS Elf_Group
    FROM input_data
),
SummedCalories AS (
    SELECT 
        Elf_Group, 
        SUM(TO_NUMBER(linetext)) AS Total_Calories
    FROM GroupedData
    WHERE TRIM(linetext) IS NOT NULL AND TRIM(linetext) <> ''
    GROUP BY Elf_Group
)
SELECT Elf_Group, Total_Calories
FROM SummedCalories
ORDER BY Total_Calories DESC
FETCH FIRST 1 ROW ONLY;
Explanation:

GroupedData CTE: This part assigns a group number to each line. It uses a window function with a cumulative sum. Every time a blank line is encountered, the sum increases, effectively starting a new group.

SummedCalories CTE: This part sums the calories for each group. It filters out blank lines and converts the linetext to a number before summing.

The final SELECT statement retrieves the group (Elf) with the highest total calories. It orders the groups by Total_Calories in descending order and fetches only the top row.

This solution assumes that the linetext column contains either a number (as a string) or a blank/NULL for the lines separating the Elves' entries. The TO_NUMBER function is used to convert the calorie values to numbers for summing, and the query handles potential blank or NULL values to avoid errors.

What is the create table statement for input_data? What insert statements would you use to populate the table?
ChatGPT
To create the input_data table and populate it with the data as described in your scenario, you would first use a CREATE TABLE statement to define the structure of the table. Then, you would use INSERT INTO statements to add the data.

Here's how you can do it:

Creating the Table
sql
Copy code
CREATE TABLE input_data (
    linenumber INT,
    linetext VARCHAR2(100)
);
In this table definition:

linenumber is an integer that represents the line number in the text file.
linetext is a string (VARCHAR2) that contains the calorie value or a blank line.
Inserting the Data
Based on the example you provided, here are the INSERT INTO statements to populate the table:

sql
Copy code
INSERT INTO input_data (linenumber, linetext) VALUES (1, '1000');
INSERT INTO input_data (linenumber, linetext) VALUES (2, '2000');
INSERT INTO input_data (linenumber, linetext) VALUES (3, '3000');
INSERT INTO input_data (linenumber, linetext) VALUES (4, NULL); -- Blank line
INSERT INTO input_data (linenumber, linetext) VALUES (5, '4000');
INSERT INTO input_data (linenumber, linetext) VALUES (6, NULL); -- Blank line
INSERT INTO input_data (linenumber, linetext) VALUES (7, '5000');
INSERT INTO input_data (linenumber, linetext) VALUES (8, '6000');
INSERT INTO input_data (linenumber, linetext) VALUES (9, NULL); -- Blank line
INSERT INTO input_data (linenumber, linetext) VALUES (10, '7000');
INSERT INTO input_data (linenumber, linetext) VALUES (11, '8000');
INSERT INTO input_data (linenumber, linetext) VALUES (12, '9000');
INSERT INTO input_data (linenumber, linetext) VALUES (13, NULL); -- Blank line
INSERT INTO input_data (linenumber, linetext) VALUES (14, '10000');
In these INSERT statements, I've used NULL to represent blank lines. Depending on how the data is actually structured and loaded, you might need to adjust this (for example, using an empty string '' instead of NULL if the blank lines are represented that way).

After executing these statements, your input_data table will be populated with the data as described, and you can then run the SQL query to analyze the calorie data as needed.
