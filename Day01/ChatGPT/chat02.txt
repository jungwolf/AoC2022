I tested your solution. I created the table and rows with your create table statement and insert statements. I then ran your code:
WITH GroupedData AS (
    SELECT 
        linenumber, 
        linetext,
        SUM(CASE WHEN TRIM(linetext) IS NULL OR TRIM(linetext) = '' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) 
            OVER (ORDER BY linenumber) AS Elf_Group
    FROM input_data
),
SummedCalories AS (
    SELECT 
        Elf_Group, 
        SUM(TO_NUMBER(linetext)) AS Total_Calories
    FROM GroupedData
    WHERE TRIM(linetext) IS NOT NULL AND TRIM(linetext) <> ''
    GROUP BY Elf_Group
)
SELECT Elf_Group, Total_Calories
FROM SummedCalories
ORDER BY Total_Calories DESC
FETCH FIRST 1 ROW ONLY;

The result had no rows. Please review your code to find the problem.

I apologize for the confusion earlier. Let's revise the approach to correctly handle the grouping of Elves and the calculation of total calories. The issue might be with how the groups are being identified and summed. We'll adjust the logic for incrementing the group number and ensure that the calorie values are correctly summed.

Here's the revised SQL query:

sql
Copy code
WITH ElfGroups AS (
    SELECT 
        linenumber, 
        linetext,
        SUM(CASE WHEN linetext IS NULL OR TRIM(linetext) = '' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) 
            OVER (ORDER BY linenumber ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS Elf_Group
    FROM input_data
),
SummedCalories AS (
    SELECT 
        Elf_Group, 
        SUM(CASE WHEN linetext IS NOT NULL AND TRIM(linetext) <> '' THEN TO_NUMBER(linetext) ELSE 0 END) AS Total_Calories
    FROM ElfGroups
    GROUP BY Elf_Group
)
SELECT Elf_Group, Total_Calories
FROM SummedCalories
WHERE Total_Calories > 0
ORDER BY Total_Calories DESC
FETCH FIRST 1 ROW ONLY;
Changes and Explanation:

ElfGroups CTE: The logic for incrementing the Elf_Group is adjusted. The SUM window function now correctly increments the group number each time a blank line (or NULL) is encountered.

SummedCalories CTE: This part sums the calories for each Elf group. It handles potential blank or NULL values in linetext and ensures that only non-blank lines are summed.

The final SELECT statement retrieves the Elf group with the highest total calories. It filters out groups with zero calories (which could represent blank lines) and orders the groups by Total_Calories in descending order, fetching only the top row.

This revised query should correctly handle the grouping and summing of calorie values, and return the Elf group carrying the most calories.
