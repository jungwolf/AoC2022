In Oracle sql, the empty string '' is considered to be NULL. Your answer doesn't take that into account. Please rewrite your answer.

Thank you for pointing out the specifics of Oracle SQL regarding empty strings being treated as NULL. Let's revise the query accordingly. In Oracle, since an empty string is equivalent to NULL, we only need to check for NULL values in linetext to identify the group boundaries.

Here's the updated SQL query:

sql
Copy code
WITH ElfGroups AS (
    SELECT 
        linenumber, 
        linetext,
        SUM(CASE WHEN linetext IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) 
            OVER (ORDER BY linenumber ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS Elf_Group
    FROM input_data
),
SummedCalories AS (
    SELECT 
        Elf_Group, 
        SUM(CASE WHEN linetext IS NOT NULL THEN TO_NUMBER(linetext) ELSE 0 END) AS Total_Calories
    FROM ElfGroups
    GROUP BY Elf_Group
)
SELECT Elf_Group, Total_Calories
FROM SummedCalories
WHERE Total_Calories > 0
ORDER BY Total_Calories DESC
FETCH FIRST 1 ROW ONLY;
Changes and Explanation:

ElfGroups CTE: The logic for incrementing the Elf_Group is adjusted to increment every time linetext is NULL, which in Oracle also covers empty strings.

SummedCalories CTE: This part sums the calories for each Elf group. It handles potential NULL values in linetext and ensures that only non-NULL lines are summed.

The final SELECT statement retrieves the Elf group with the highest total calories. It filters out groups with zero calories (which could represent blank lines) and orders the groups by Total_Calories in descending order, fetching only the top row.

This revised query should work correctly in Oracle SQL, taking into account its treatment of empty strings as NULL.
